Noticing I have a couple potentially misleading comments due to the convos... keep the great questions coming and I'll clear anything up in the DMs if you have any confusion 🙂

One thing to note, there are no intentions to turn `permissionedStrategists` false until we have a new v2 protocol which we will likely re-audit. So most of these external functions are effectively admin only within the Rubicon Pools system (v1, this version)


[05/25/2022 4:40 PM] benjamin4
Also note, there's no function to initialize a `rewardsVestingWallet` yet though when that time comes, I'll add an external `onlyBathHouse` function on `BathToken.sol` to handle this and have the admin write in the new vesting wallet (which will be a `BathBuddy.sol`) to each BathToken's storage. These bath buddies will represent the contract that will hold bonus ERC-20 rewards. In the near-term, this will be OP as our project received a phase 0 allocation 🙂


[05/25/2022 4:40 PM] benjamin4
^ This is possible due to everything being proxy-wrapped today, ability to iterate fast ⚡


[05/26/2022 12:05 AM] bearprince
what's with the strategistUtility contract? I don't see it on the repo


[05/26/2022 2:31 PM] un_for_given
Hi @benjamin | rubicon.finance , You mentioned in code RubiconMarket is based on "open-source work of Oasis DEX". would you please provide us with their diff so we could concentrate on what you have changed in your protocol?


[05/26/2022 2:56 PM] benjamin4
Gm everyone!

[05/26/2022 2:57 PM] benjamin4
This is a utility contract that right now does nothing but execute a UNI trade. We are using this as a tool kit for executing strategist trades and decided to keep it off of the audit. LMK if you would like more details 🙂


[05/26/2022 2:58 PM] benjamin4
Totally! Everything that was changed has added Natspec comments. The only main changes are light storage changes (mostly unused tbh) to the high-level RubiconMarket and *adding the bolt-on fee functionality in the SimpleMarket `buy`*


[05/26/2022 2:59 PM] benjamin4
Note, the vast majority of the logic is unchanged, really just the fee and making ExpiringMarket never expire 🙂

HMU!

Here's a helpful resource on Proxies that I forgot to link in the comments. Note that we use `TransparentUpgradeableProxy`'s for all contracts in this system today so we can iterate the code while centralized: https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/proxies

Please also note, `isClosed()` should always return false and is a bit vestigial on `RubiconMarket.sol`


[05/26/2022 9:34 PM] rotcivegaf
The RubiconRouter.sol is in the scope?

"Note, there are more minor contracts noted under “Periphery” - these are also included in the scope of the contest."
This refer to peripheral_contracts?


[05/26/2022 10:24 PM] benjamin4
RubiconRouter is! All the contracts listed on the contest page by name 🙂
